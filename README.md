# 🗃️ Custom SQL Project – Business Insights with AdventureWorks

This project uses a simulated enterprise database (AdventureWorks) to showcase advanced SQL querying, data analysis logic, and business-oriented thinking. Through a set of complex SQL queries, we extract insights related to customers, orders, products, and employee performance.

---

## 📌 Project Scope

The objective is to simulate real-world analytics tasks over a structured database using advanced SQL. Core goals:

- Write and explain 10–15 business-focused queries
- Utilize complex SQL techniques: joins, subqueries, window functions, and CTEs
- Build and share a visual ERD of the database
- (Optional) Visualize output in Streamlit or Power BI

---

## 🧩 Dataset

We’re using the **AdventureWorks** database — a mock dataset of a manufacturing company with rich entities like:

- Customers & Regions  
- Products & Categories  
- Orders & Invoices  
- Employees & Territories  

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **SQL Engine**: PostgreSQL  
- **Query Tool**: DBeaver / DB Fiddle / Jupyter with `sqlite3`  
- **ERD Design**: dbdiagram.io or SQLDBM  
- **Optional Output**: Power BI or Streamlit  

---

## 🔄 Example Query Themes (Planned)

- Top 5 customers by revenue across years  
- Monthly sales growth per region  
- Employee performance vs team averages  
- First purchase date per customer  
- Average order value trend by product category  
- Lead time analysis between orders  

---

## 📊 Status

⏳ Query development in progress.  
📅 ERD and initial insights to be published soon.  

---

## 🔮 Next Steps

- Build complete query suite with markdown notes  
- Add ERD visual and index suggestions  
- Package insights in a small dashboard (Power BI or Streamlit)  

Stay tuned for updates!
